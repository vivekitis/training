Bombay Safari, Gateway of India, near Taj Mahal Hotel, Colaba (2281-0139). Rs 40-90.
* Take a break from the city. Vasai offers the ramparts of Bassein fort, ruins of Portugese churches and East Indian food. Vasai may now be just one more stop on the northern fringes of the suburban line of the Western Railway but back in the day, the 1600s to be precise, Vasai was where all the action was. The birthplace of the only Indian Catholic saint, Gonsalo Garcia, and a jewel in the Portuguese crown, Vasai fort, or Bassein as it was then known as, was filled with impressive public buildings, imposing private mansions and soaring churches.

Near Colgate factory and Sewri Jetty, Sewri.
* Eat nihari, kebabs and sweetmeats around Masjid on the eve of Eid (Ramzan)
* Get lost in the crowds of Ganesh Chaturthi (Sep). Dance with Ganpati. Among the hundreds of processions that throng the Haji Ali waterfront, the Dance with Ganesh truck is one of the biggest.

On Sept 25 this year, the final day of the Ganesh festival, organisers DJs Asad and Hussain will play house, trance and assorted electronic sounds 2pm onwards from Mahalaxmi temple to the Worli immersion site..

## Food and Drink
* Smoke a hookah at roof-top restaurant Koyla in the Arab quarters of Colaba
* Sip beer at Sea View. From the outside, Sea View barely shows any signs of life. But hidden within is a gem of a restaurant. Pork chilly fry, potato chips (not French fries) and onion bhajia go beautifully with beer, which is the only alcohol available.. Hotel Sea View, Juhu Tara Road, Juhu Beach, (2660-5942). Daily 9am-11.30pm.
* Figure what all the fuss is about having a beer in Mondegar or Leopold
* Drink Kingfisher, Cobra or Zingaro in your neighborhood look-alike bar of Nightlovers
* Party at Hard Rock Cafe and mourn for a minute the death of mills around Parel
* Guzzle cheap wine at Ivy. Ivy has none of that old-world hokum of zero-watt lighting, wood panelling and leather sofas. Instead, this little bar in Worli has brightly coloured walls, genial waiters and pretty much all types of fermented grape found in the Narayangaon area. Bacchus would be pleased.. Indage House, Annie Besant Road, Worli (6610-0910). Daily 11am-11pm.
* Drink beer at Janata. Janata is a regular working-class bar, like the hundreds of such boozers that dot Mumbai. It has the same Formica benches and tables, the menu offers similar Mangalorean and Indian-Chinese pub grub and the alcohol too is identical. Yet, Janata has acquired a certain cache, primarily because it’s the quintessential Mumbai dive – even if it is now the spot for the more high-brow to slum it out.. Janata, Pali Naka, Bandra (W) (2600-4049). Daily 10.30am-1.30am.
* Eat street food at a khau galli. Pick from batatawadas, pudlas and other innovations that you get only on Mumbai’s streets, such as the Schezwan dosa. Wash these down with the medley of fruit and ice-cream called “fruit slad”.. Third Agiary Lane, Zaveri Bazaar. Also at New Marine Lines.

Friends Union Joshi Club, Kalbadevi (2205-8089). Mon-Sat 11am-3pm & 7-10pm; Sun 11am-3pm. Rs 70.
* Munch idlis at Café Madras. The idlis at Café Madras are probably the best you’ll ever get outside of a south Indian home in Mumbai. The restaurant’s recipe shuns the Shetty-style rice grits in favour of the pricier but more flavourful urad dal, uses old-school slow steamers to retain moisture and texture and serves up its idlis with sambar, home-made butter and mulagapudi.. King’s Circle, Matunga (2401-4419). Tue-Sun 7am-2.30pm, 4pm-11pm. Rs 13.
* Devour a divine brownie. If heaven were to take the form of a dessert, it would come in the shape of a Theobroma chocolate chip brownie.

* Drink cutting chai. Learn out the art of ordering tea in a streetside cafe. “Ek paani kum dena.”
* Try the green chilli ice cream at Bachelorrs
* Swing to some live music as you enjoy your continental meal at Not Just Jazz By The Bay. Do pay attention to the witty hoarding outside as you leave the place
* Discover the charm of marble tabletops, bentwood chairs and irani chai at Parsi cafes
* Sip Irish coffee at Prithvi. Although the management denies that there’s any liquor in the Irish coffee, the drink is the most sought-after item on the menu of Prithvi Café, the suburban hangout of choice for theatrewallahs and television actors.. Prithvi Café, Janki Kutir, Juhu Church Road, Vile Parle (W) (2614-9546). Tue-Sun 12.30-11.30pm, Mon 3-11pm.

* Have pao bhaji at Sardar. Expect up to 50gm of Amul butter in your plate of pao bhaji. But don’t let the butter scare you away. The signature dish at Sardar in Tardeo may be all wrong for dieters, but clearly does a lot right for the palate.. Tardeo Road Junction, Tardeo (2353-0208). Daily 11am-2am. Rs 47.
* Eat ayurvedic food. Swadshakti is probably Mumbai’s only ayurvedic restaurant, where a chunk of the menu is dedicated to detoxifying “panchakarma” dishes. The lack of spice in the dishes may take some getting used to, but the palate is disciplined, the flavours of the healing herbs that the restaurant uses liberally – ginger, garlic and fenugreek, among others – will emerge more strongly.. Swadshakti, Bhadran Nagar Cross Road 2, opposite Milap theatre, Malad (W) (2806-5757). Daily 10am-10pm.
* Gorge on Sarvi’s kebabs. Sarvi in Nagpada has been serving up the most tender seekhs since the 1930s, when it was frequented by Urdu writers and poets.. Zuber Sofia Road, opposite Nagpada Police Station, Nagpada Junction (98335-33305). Daily 5am-12.30am. Seekh kebabs Rs 24.
